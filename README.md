### Algorithms
Contains a collection of algorithms that I have practiced while preparing for interviews or I was asked in the interviews.
You will find a few left with instructions but not yet coded, I plan to code them some time. These are in following broad categories.
I have tried to add unit tests but as always tests lag behind.

#### Categories
- array
- back tracking
- dynamic programming
- graph
- list
- matrix
- search
- sort
- stacks and queues
- stream
- string
- tree
- trie
- misc in "nocetegory"
